                <h1>Week 1 Discussion</h1>
                <p>1) Compass, accelerometer, camera, audio, geo-location, video, and more (especially with phonegap).</p>
                <p>2) Of these most don't seem to fit well with a basic crud functioning app, but the camera might be useful in my app.</p>
                <p>3) In regards to workflow, I just read/watch all materials for the week as early as possible.  Then I can gauge decently how much time I will need.  After that it is simply getting started and sticking to it at a regular pace, keeping distractions to a minimum.</p>
                <p>4) The design of my app right now lends itself well to what it intends to accomplish.  It's a pretty straightforward contacts book (with it's own spin), so it doesn't really need distractions.</p>             
                <p>5) As my old app is working, I'll probably leave it alone.  As for revising my app, I look forward to figuring out the best features to incorporate into it.</p>
            </article>
            <article data-role="collapsible">
                <h1>Week 2 Discussion</h1>
                <p>1) What I can do in my webpages is keeping the code clean and using the right elements where they belong.  Elements like alt tags, headings, lists, forms (label inputs with meaning!), ect.  Elements the reader goes through should be able to cue the user on what to do next, without nearby visual aids.</p>
				<p>2) One thing that I saw in a video was how dynamic content was relayed to the user.  If new content is injected, there is a way for that content to be read to, or alert, the user.  But one thing to keep in mind is that if content is updated in a rapid way, it could result in lost information to the user, or even a garbled mess.  To work with this, content should be updated in a way that the user will be able to absorb new information at their own pace, resulting in all information being available to each type of user.</p>
				<p>3) Refreshing Braille displays are one type of device made for accessability.  The work they do is giving a physical way for people to read (through Braille) what is currently on a computer screen.  I saw a video where a man used it to read what his iPhone was doing, and also to run commands to his iPhone in turn.</p>
				<p>  Apart from the Refreshing Braille displays, most phones have begun to adopt some form of Accessibility.  Blackberry phones have options for hearing, vision, mobility, cognitive, and speech disabilities.  iPhone lists hearing, vision, and cognitive solutions as well.  Android is working toward the same direction as the others, with a special note to Google's work in general.  They are coming out with ChromeVox which will be a screenreader built for web, integrated right into Chrome.  Additionally they have improved most of their services, and even put in the automatic subtitle generation for YouTube.</p>
				<p>4) One app I came across during my research was WalkyTalky.  It is an app that updates the user on their location, and can even set a destination and work in a Walking directions mode.  Seems pretty cool.  Another app is Wireless Accessibility, apparently 10 features in one app: Phone, Contacts, SMS, Alarm, Calendar, Email, Web, Where am I, Apps and Settings.  It simplifies the interface and uses voice to help the user traverse the phone easier.</p>

                <h1>Week 3 Discussion</h1>
                <p>1) US:  Games, entertainment, social networking, photography</p>
                <p>2) UK:  Games, social networking, sports and entertainment, weather</p>
                <p>3) JP:  Games, entertainment, social networking, photography</p>
                <p>4) Seems that games and would be good apps to work on, and then integrate them into social networking.</p>
                <p>5) I couldn't find documented information that specifically said what each countries market share was.  Globally, there is a 1.2% market share for ICS.  This means that developing an app, to be successful right now, a developer should not aim for that OS.  The largest market share is 2.3.3, which would net the largest user base.</p>
                <p>6) This was some hard data to track down, but piecing together data plans and info from provider websites and comparison websites showed most plans are probably 30$-100$, with a 10$ charge per GB overage.  These are for plans from 2 GB to 10GB.  Most of the results I found when searching for this topic were about how much data we are using, and quickly.  With 4G networking now, and HD streaming video and music, GB's of data can be burned through in hours.  For a developer this means that costing their users money because of online content is a very real thing.  Keeping that in mind as we develop web and native apps will be crucial to success.</p>
                <p>7) Seeing as how games are far and away the most downloaded, that would be a good start.  Entertainment and social networking are good categories, but are different than games in one large aspect.  These categories are where you find the need and build an app that people download and use on a daily basis as a tool.  ESPN or Facebook connect the user to new content, thats their role.  Games -are- the content, and as such games do come and go quickly (this attributes to why the games category is the largest in downloads.  people look for new games!)</p>
                <p>This doesn't mean that the social and entertainment apps won't be adopted as quickly as new games.  They are still very solid things to develop.  The goal though, is to develop something that users latch onto, and integrate into their work-flow or life.  Or perhaps, develop something that can connect things they already do into an efficient method.  Kind of like the goal of RSS feeds - 5 magazines make apps for their articles, someone makes 1 app that brings in any of the 5 magazine's articles.  Bam, people do that because it is more efficient (and hopefully it is well designed as well).</p>
                <p>Besides realizing what type of app you need to make, the audience is always the most important.  Thats what looking up these trends are for:  What areas are successful, and what uses or needs can you target.</p>
